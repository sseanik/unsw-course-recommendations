* **COMP3900** [CORE] - Computer Science Project
 	* **Description**: 
	* **Difficulty**: 
	* **Review**: 
* **COMP9321** [FREE] - Data Service Engineering
 	* **Description**: You learn about Python, in particular Pandas and Numpy with tabular data manipulation. Pretty easy python stuff. Then onto Rest APIs, in particular with Flask Restx (which is Flask + Swagger documentation), then an Intro to Machine learning.
	* **Lecturer**: Morty
	* **Difficulty**: Easy. You learn Python and Flask in COMP1531, so that part is easy.
	* **Review**: Great course to take a breather in. No tutorials. Only 3 assignments and an exam. Both the assignments and exam have some written components (so a bit of theory) and coding components.

### 21T2
* **COMP6771** [FREE] - Advanced C++
 	* **Description**: You simply learn how to code in C++ in a very efficient way. Big trading companies (e.g. Optiver, IMC) love C++, and mostly use it, so it's quite a beneficial language to learn. Big game companies (e.g. Wargaming) love C++ too.
	* **Lecturer**: Hayden
	* **Difficulty**: Medium - Hard. It can be difficult to grasp, but
	* **Review**: Hayden is a fantastic lecturer. You only really have 3 assignments and an exam, so the course is basically all practical. The assignments are hardish. They take time to complete. There are tutorials, but I never attended any. Hayden also recorded his tutes, so I just watched those.
* **COMP9323** [FREE] - Software as a Service Project
 	* **Description**: 
	* **Difficulty**: 
	* **Review**:
